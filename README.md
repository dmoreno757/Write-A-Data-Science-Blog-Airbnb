## Summary:
For this project I'm looking into the airbnb data for seattle listing. With Seattle being a major hot spot of toursim, I wanted to see how users look into airbnb and how they grab rentals. These are the questions I'm looking into.
1. Does holidays affect Airbnb prices?
2. Does proberty type affect the price for a listing?
3. Does reviews cause which neighboorhood will be rented out more?

## Libaries
- pandas
- matplotlib
- warnings
- datetime

## Data Information
I'm using three types of datasets of airbnb for this project. One is for the dates and prices of an airbnb, listings information of the airbnblisting, and finally the review of the listing. For my analysis I only used two types of datasets the calendar one and the listing one. These both helped me answer my questions.

## How to run
1. The jupyter notebook is an enviornment of testing and analysing in helping me answer my solutions
2. To run you must use the jupyter notebook and select run
